* Fix the NOTEs:
 - Found object files/libraries: src/liborigin/*.o
   (why don't they get deleted on R CMD build?)
 - Found hidden files and directories: src/liborigin/.git
   (how to get R CMD build to exclude it?)
 - Compiled code should not call entry points which might terminate R nor
   write to stdout/stderr instead of to the console, nor the system RNG.
   ‘liborigin/OriginFile.o’, ‘liborigin/OriginAnyParser.o’: std::cerr
   ‘liborigin/OriginAnyParser.o’: std::cout
   (use subtrees instead of submodules and patch the code?)
